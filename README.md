# Hospital Bed Demand Forecasting: A Case Study from Health Industry

We describe our approach towards the hospital bed demand forecasting in Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan) for new hospital building capacity planning and rationalization. Autoregression
was used to project future population size. The hospital bed demand was forecasted using the regression model built on the data available on past years’ population sizes and respective demand calculated on the disease diagnosis and hospitalization rates information.

The method is fully described in the article https://www.polibits.cidetec.ipn.mx/2020_61/Hospital%20Bed%20Demand%20Forecasting_%20A%20Case%20Study%20from%20Health%20Industry.pdf.
